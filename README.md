# rest-spring

---

A simple REST API using Spring Boot, according to the instructions from [Getting Started | Building a RESTful Web Service](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/) from `spring.io`.

Modified to serve hard-coded stocks as a proof-of-concept for team Kaiserschmarrn, COMS W4156.

## Quick start

- Run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` on the command line from the root of this project to start the server
- Go to [http://localhost:8080/api/AMZN](http://localhost:8080/AMZN) to see the service up and running
  - Any string after `/api/` works
